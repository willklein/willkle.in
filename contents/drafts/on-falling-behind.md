I came across an interesting question on a JavaScript message board:

> If youâ€™re not on ES6 yet, are you falling behind?

I responded:

> ...the new syntax is a breathe of fresh air. I wouldn't say you're falling behind; it's more like you're missing out.

There's a lot of new things to be learning/trying/using; ES6 is just one of them. There will _always_ be new things.

Besides core language features for whatever platform you work on, almost everything else is optional. You need to know _some_ of those things, but not all. You can't and shouldn't try to keep up with everything. You get to _choose which things you learn._

I chose to learn the latest JavaScript syntax, and a bunch of other things, but not everything. The stuff I haven't bothered learning? I'm probably missing out on some cool things. That's OK though, because I've chosen stuff that interests me and I'm enjoying every bit of it.

Don't worry about everything; keep learning something.
